Supervised Machine Learning with the Iris flower data set and the scikit-learn python library.

This project is a supervised learning, classification problem with multiple classes. In this project, I will compare and contrast the performance of three different learning models on the  common and publicly available Iris Flower dataset.

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
